&lt;p&gt;stals and money! I even had the incredible opportunity to work with Brent Atwater, the world&amp;rsquo;s leading expert on animal souls. Since 2008 I&amp;rsquo;ve helped 3K+ people in over 40 countries on all kinds of animal/pet projects involving health, behavior, after death transitions, finding lost pets andprotecting pets from harm.
HOW I LEARNED ABOUT THE AFTERLIFE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was small, I was touched by the spirit of my late great-grandma Mary and my footstep-father’s mother, Bessie. Well, I guess they touched me because my mom described a time I climbed up on go twice my size and shouted, “Get away from me.” The next day I told my mom I didn&amp;rsquo;t like to be touched on the shoulder and by the back of the head and she began to realize who had visited me! But, the creative part of my soul began to ignite when I was 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see spirits or ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a little drawing I did at age 10 with the face of a spirit of a girl who sat on my bed. I was doodling buteventually realized that a picture was forming, and it scaredme! Recently, my mom needed me to house/pet sit for 3 months. I was reluctant to do it. When she came over to show me what&amp;rsquo;s what, and when I walked up to the house, it gave me a sensation I can&amp;rsquo;t even describe. I had to keep walking and think about it. The thought ofroommates with me and my dogsPogs made me laugh out loud. While I was meditating, I kept hearing my dogs howling. It would last a few seconds and then stopped. People told me that my dogs were trying to get my attention. It clicked! My dogs could see my deadroommates! Here is my favorite part. My mom told me not to contact my roommate&amp;rsquo;s mother. Here&amp;rsquo;s why: My roommate&amp;rsquo;s dad wasoh so departed.He lived a few miles away. My roommate&amp;rsquo;s mother insisted that he visit one time in the whole time her son lived with my mom. She gave him a whole 10 minutes. He stood up the third time his son invited him to dinner. When my mom called to tell me about my roomie and her mom, I could see exactly what she meant. I told my mom to tell the lady that if I can’t speak to her about things about her son she couldn’t speak to me about it. I could be pretty feisty with my tail in the air like my late border collie babe Zack. When I went to Uncle Joe&amp;rsquo;s housealittle while ago, he mentioned that when my mom was little a woman used to come to his house late at night. Joe lived in the apartment in the back of his dad&amp;rsquo;s grocerystore. She would knock and knock on the door and the apartmentVibrated! The door opened, and she would be gone! Joe has seen spirits too. What we both have in common is that we have our mental &amp;ldquo;hair trigger” up. We see everybody. It’s always been moderate for me because the creative part of my soul speaks the loudest, and the sensory perception part of my soul was not high priority for me. Through the years, I picked up a few more sensory perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHAT I DO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it’s all about manifestation. The animal portion of my lotus splits into a beautiful vortex, and I go where I am most needed. On the side of the vortex is a cat that visits. Sometimes I walk her when she’s in foal. Sometimes I give birth to kittenss. Sometimes we go to that dude who parts horses&amp;rsquo; manes out of their eyes. Sometimes, I go to other places too. Everything I first experienced as the animal, I experienced again as the human. For example, when I was in the horse world for 7 years, I read a book about a horse lady who came out of a dream, and it felt like it as if inside of me. I dreamed of adopting a horse from a slaughterhouse. His name was Dad. The rest is history! After I rescued Dad, I actually worked for 2 slaughter rescues for about a year and a half. As a human, I dreamed of riding a big ugly gray horse named Russ Clark. Every time I saw him from afar, he would look up, and our eyes met in time, space, and space. After I had learned to tölt and a little four beat canter, I became super expressive and people gravitated to me. Not going to lie - I even had a few dates and some serious offers of marriage. I never dated but I gained some self-worth. To make many more things short, I helped anotherownerevery day with Russ. She allowed me to ride him once a week in exchange for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advanced-civilization&#34;&gt;Advanced civilization&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was once a planet that was home to a beautiful and advanced civilization. But when a great war tore the planet apart, the people of this civilization were forced to flee their homes. They were forced to start anew on a barren and hostile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For generations, the people of this civilization struggled to survive. They were plagued by disease, hunger, and violence. But they persevered, and their civilization began to flourish once more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the people of this civilization were haunted by their past. They suffered from nightmares and flashbacks of the war that had destroyed their home. They were also tormented by the memories of their loved ones who had died in the war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, a scientist from this civilization made a breakthrough. He discovered a way to reborn the people of his civilization. The scientist was able to take the memories of the people&amp;rsquo;s past lives and implant them into the minds of the people of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of this civilization were initially reluctant to undergo the procedure. But when they saw how much it improved their lives, they decided to undergo the rebirth. They were                                                         no longer haunted by their pasts. They were able to live their lives to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the people of this civilization soon realized that they were not the only ones who had been reborn. The people of other civilizations had also been reborn into this world. And they were not the only ones who were suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people of this world began to realize that they were all suffering from the same nightmares and flashbacks. They were all haunted by the same memories. They were all living in a world full of suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even in the midst of all this suffering, the people of this world were able to find hope. They were able to find comfort in each other. They were able to find a way to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(qui n&amp;rsquo;est qu&amp;rsquo;une nouvelle façon d&amp;rsquo;épeler le vieux tutoiement), et se repaitre avec délectation des formes élancées, déstructurées ou courbes, soyeuses ou bouclées !&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bon lundi de rentée à tous ! Et bienvenu en parfum-land si vous passez par là pour la première fois !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;death-lullaby&#34;&gt;Death lullaby&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the darkness of the night,
I see a haunting sight,
A figure beckoning me,
With a face so grim and dreary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a voice so cold and dead,
It whispers in my ear,
&amp;ldquo;Come with me, my child,
For in death, you will be wild.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to run and hide,
But the figure is by my side,
It grabs my hand and leads me on,
To a place where I don&amp;rsquo;t belong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel a sense of dread,
As I approach the edge,
A sense of guilt consumes me,
For the things that I have done and said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to plead and bargain,
But the figure is unyielding,
It drags me to the edge of the abyss,
And I am forced to face my own demise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scream and cry out,
But no one hears my shout,
I am alone with my guilt and fear,
As I plummet into the abyss of death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as I fall, I see a light,
A glimmer of hope in the endless night,
A chance to atone for my mistakes,
And to find peace in the afterlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reach out towards the light,
And it surrounds me with its warmth,
I am forgiven for my sins,
And I am finally free from guilt and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you ever find yourself,
Facing death and its cold embrace,
Remember that there is always hope,
And that forgiveness is never out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-we-suffer--&#34;&gt;Why we suffer ? !&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Bible, human suffering and death are often discussed as a result of the Fall of Man. In the book of Genesis, God created the world and everything in it, including Adam and Eve, the first human beings. God placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and told them that they could eat from any tree in the garden except for the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a serpent tempted Eve to eat from the forbidden tree, and she in turn convinced Adam to do the same. As a result of their disobedience, God punished Adam and Eve by banishing them from the Garden of Eden and subjecting them to a life of hardship and suffering. This event is known as the Fall of Man, and it is often seen as the reason for human suffering and death in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the story of the Fall of Man, the Bible also discusses suffering and death as a result of human sin and disobedience. Throughout the Old and New Testaments, there are many examples of people experiencing suffering and death as a consequence of their actions or the actions of others. For example, in the story of Cain and Abel, Cain kills his brother Abel out of jealousy, and as a result he is punished with a life of wandering and exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the New Testament, Jesus Christ teaches about the importance of accepting suffering and even death for the sake of others. He himself endured great suffering and ultimately died on the cross as a sacrifice for the sins of humanity. In this way, the Bible presents suffering and death as a natural part of the human experience, but also as an opportunity for redemption and salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;superintelligence---&#34;&gt;SuperIntelligence &amp;ndash;&amp;gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way in recent years, with many experts predicting that we are on the brink of a new era in which machines will surpass human intelligence. This phenomenon is known as superintelligence, and it is both exciting and terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, superintelligence has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, from medicine and transportation to education and entertainment. AI-powered machines could be capable of solving complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of human minds, and they could help us to make incredible technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are also many concerns about the potential dangers of superintelligence. For example, some experts worry that if AI becomes more intelligent than humans, it could potentially become a threat to our very existence. Machines that are capable of thinking for themselves and making decisions based on their own goals and motivations could pose a serious risk to human beings, especially if those goals and motivations are not aligned with our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid the potential dangers of superintelligence, it is important that we carefully consider the ethical implications of AI technology and develop strict guidelines and regulations to govern its use. We must also invest in research and development that will help us to understand the potential risks of superintelligence and to find ways to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the potential of superintelligence is both exciting and terrifying, and it is up to us as a society to ensure that we harness its power for the greater good. By carefully considering the ethical implications of AI technology and taking steps to mitigate potential risks, we can unlock the incredible potential of superintelligence and create a brighter future for all.&lt;/p&gt;
