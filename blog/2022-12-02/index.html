<p>I was tasked to create a CNN for a project in a hackathon named &ldquo;AITHON&rdquo; conducted by the IEEE club in my college.</p>
<p>The first step in creating a CNN for a project in a hackathon is to define the problem. What is the goal of the project? What data is available? What is the desired outcome? Once the problem is clearly defined, the next step is to develop a strategy for building the CNN. This includes selecting the appropriate architecture, layers, and hyperparameters. Additionally, the data should be preprocessed and split into training, validation, and testing sets. After the CNN is built, it should be tested and evaluated to ensure it is performing as expected. Finally, the model should be deployed and used to generate predictions.</p>
<h3 id="the-steps-i-followed-were">The steps I followed were:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Collect and preprocess the data: I gathered images of people with different emotions and preprocessed them to ensure they were of the same size and format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the CNN architecture: I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with multiple layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Train the model: I used the training data to train the model, adjusting the hyperparameters to optimize the model‚Äôs performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test the model: I tested the model on the validation data to evaluate its performance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy the model: I deployed the model to a web application and used it to generate predictions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Tools I&rsquo;ve used in the development of the CNN are jupyter notebook and google colab to write the code, tensorflow and keras for building the model, opencv for preprocessing the data, and matplotlib for visualizing the results.
Also, I used a library called sklearn for splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, and for optimizing the hyperparameters.</p>
<h4 id="why-sklearnhttpsgithubcomscikit-learnscikit-learn">why <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">sklearn</a>?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Sklearn is a powerful library for machine learning that provides a wide range of tools for data preprocessing, model building, and model evaluation. It is particularly useful for splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets, as well as for optimizing hyperparameters. Additionally, it provides a range of metrics for evaluating the performance of a model.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-kerashttpsgithubcomkeras-teamkeras">why <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras">keras</a>?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Keras is a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. It is easy to use and provides a range of tools for building complex models. Additionally, it is compatible with a variety of backends, including TensorFlow, which makes it a great choice for building CNNs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I Would probably publish my model on a platform such as Kaggle or GitHub and make it available to the public soon as I am free.</p>
<p>And this Entire blog was created using openai&rsquo;s GPT-3 model text-davinci-003 using the openai API and python.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I wanted to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenAI&rsquo;s GPT-3 model and how it can be used to generate text. GPT-3 is a powerful language model that can generate text based on a prompt. By using the OpenAI API and Python, I was able to generate this blog post with minimal effort.(This was also written by the ai. sed :| )</p>
<p>Ig Ai was kool after all. Now I need to learn more about this.</p>
